Hello! I’m a fourth-year student at [Chaminade University of Honolulu](https://chaminade.edu){target="blank_"}, studying on community and public health and health informatics and analytics. I’m passionate about advancing research, health policy, and advocacy within reproductive health and justice, particularly menstrual health. Outside of that, I love volunteering in various community health initiatives, practicing hatha yoga, writing, arranging flowers, and getting lost in a good mystery, fantasy, or romance novel! Feel free to explore more [about my work and interests](about.qmd)!
